description: 'Flexibly responding to sensory stimuli depending on rules is critical
  for adapting in a constantly changing environment. However, it remains unclear how
  the brain encodes rule information and uses this information to guide behavioral
  responses to sensory stimuli. Here, we made single-unit recordings while head-fixed
  mice performed a cross-modal sensory selection task in which they switched between
  two rules in different blocks of trials: licking in response to tactile stimuli
  while rejecting visual stimuli, or licking to visual stimuli while rejecting tactile
  stimuli. Along the cortical processing stream, touch-evoked responses in primary
  (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory cortical areas, and in the medial (MM) and
  anterolateral (ALM) motor cortical areas were modulated by rules at a single-neuron
  level. In addition, the activity of individual cortical neurons prior to stimulus
  delivery also changed in a rule-dependent manner. We proposed that rule-dependent
  pre-stimulus activity may contribute to setting the cortical areas in different
  initial conditions, which prepares them to process sensory information according
  to the appropriate rule. This hypothesis was supported by our findings that (1)
  the task rules could be decoded from the pre-stimulus population states of the sensory
  and motor cortical areas, (2) cortical areas with a larger difference in pre-stimulus
  state between rules used better separated subspaces to process subsequent tactile
  signals, and (3) optogenetic disruption of pre-stimulus states within the motor
  cortical areas impaired rule-dependent tactile detection. Taken together, our findings
  suggest that rule-guided sensorimotor flexibility may occur via appropriate configuration
  of pre-stimulus states within motor cortical networks, enabling distinct actions
  in response to the same sensory input.'
